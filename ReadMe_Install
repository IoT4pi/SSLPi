ReadMe Installation
===================
First thing first:
Thank you for downloading our Software SSLPi: 
Read this ReadMe before the ReadMe for the Configuration (File ReadMe_Config).

So let's get started: 
=====================
After downloading the SSLPI_VersX.tar.gz to your System (Raspberry pi) to any given directory 
and extract it with the command

    $ tar -zxvf SSLPI_VersX.tar.gz


this generate a directory SSLPi_VerX.
(The X will vary depending on the version you have downloaded)

Change into the directory with

    $ cd SSLPI_VersX

There you will see with "ls -l"

 pi@Mypi ~/SSLPi_VersX $ ls -l
 total 48
 drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi  4096 Jan 27 13:12 app
 drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi  4096 Jan 27 13:12 Test
 -rwxr-xr-x 1 pi pi  6656 Jan 27 14:23 Install.sh
 -rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi  4923 Jan 27 15:30 ReadMe_Install
 -rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi  4923 Jan 27 15:30 ReadMe_Config
- rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi  4923 Jan 27 15:30 SSLPi.cfg
 -rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 21557 Jan 27 15:24 SSLserverPi_VX.py
 -rwxr-xr-x 1 pi pi   550 Jan 27 15:30 startSSLPi.sh

In the app directory are sample application, to show you how to configure 
the SSLPi to your own demands. 

In the TestClient directory is a sample Python SSL Client 
You can use it and modify it to your own needs. 
It is tested to work together with SSLPi Server.

To start the installation type 

 $ sudo ./Install.sh

The script is going to proof if the prerequisite software is on your system.
It actually checks if the Python2.7 and OpenSSL is installed. 
If not, it will exit the install script and you have to install the missing software. 

As an information: 
    you can install OpenSSL with
        $ sudo apt-get install openssl

    you can install python with
        $ sudo apt-get install python2.7
            But I do not think this will happen very often, 
            because the Raspberry (& Raspian) runs Python 2.7 out of the box

Next you will be asked for directory, where the SSLPi Server has to be installed. If you do not specify a 
directory, the default directory will be created. the default directory is 
     /home/pi/SSLPi/

Next type in where to install the certificates. The default directory is 
    /home/pi/SSLPi/Cert/

As a next step the script is creating the certificates. 
You have to type in a password three times. It has to be the same password, all the time. 

Afterwards you are asked for several pieces of information.
!!!One of the prompts will be for "Common Name (e.g., YOUR name)". It is important 
that this field be filled in with the fully qualified domain name of the server to be protected by SSL.


    Country Name (2 letter code) [GB]:DE
    State or Province Name (full name) [Berkshire]:Bavaria
    Locality Name (eg, city) [Newbury]:Munich
    Organization Name (eg, company) [My Company Ltd]:IoT4pi
    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Information Technology
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    !!!!!Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:iot4pi.com !!!!!!!!
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    Email Address []:office@iot4pi
    Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
    to be sent with your certificate request
    A challenge password []:
    An optional company name []:

If you have everything provided, the the script will finish successfully.
The server will now start automatically at the reboot of the Raspberry pi. 
Per default the server will listen at port 10023.

You can now proof that everything is running OK by:
    
    Testing if it starts at Boot with command 
        $sudo crontab -l
            it should present a line like:
            @reboot sudo /home/pi/SSLPi/startSSLPi.sh >> /home/pi/SSLPi/log 2>&1


    after reboot you can test if the server is running with
        $ ps aux | grep SSLserverPi
            this should bring something like
 
            root 2133 0.0  0.5  4592 2640 ?  S  08:49 0:00 sudo python /home/pi/SSLPi/SSLserverPi_VX.py

You will find the Server application in the specified installation directory. In this directory there
will be the app directory with the sample scripts. 
The Certificates will be stored in the specified certification directory. There you will find

    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1147 Jan 27 15:31 server.cer
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1679 Jan 27 15:30 server.key
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1751 Jan 27 15:30 server.orig.key
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1338 Jan 27 15:31 server.pem
 

The file server.pem is the important file you will need for the clients. This file you have to copy and
provide your clients with it. This one is the key to establish a communication withe the server. 
Without it, the server would reject any communication attempt.
